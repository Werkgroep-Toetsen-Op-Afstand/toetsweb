    "home.heroSubtitle": "On this website you can complete the Assessment Web Scan with your degree course team, the assessment or curriculum committee of your team or another relevant representation of the degree course. The Assessment Web Scan is based on the methodology of the 'Asssement Assessed' and is intended to analyze, improve and guarantee the quality of the assessment. The Assessment Web forms the theoretical foundation of the 'Assessment Assessed'.",
    "home.assessmentQualityTitle": "Jointly determine assessment quality",
    "home.assessmentQualityText": "With the help of the Assessment Web you can determine together as a team what the (sustainable) quality of assessment currently looks like in your degree course (position determination). With the help of this scan, you can also make choices together about your development towards (sustainable) assessment quality (ambition determination). In addition, you use the scan with your team to make a substantiated action plan to achieve your ambition.",
    "home.assessmentExplainedTitle": "The Assessment Web explained",
    "home.assessmentExplainedText": "The Assessment Web consists of five assessment entities; assessment (tasks), assessment programme, assessment policy, assessment organisation and assessment literacy. These five entities are connected with one another and also with the centre of the web. The shape of the web symbolizes the interconnectedness of the different assessment entities, makes it visually visible that they are all connected to each other and shows four different development phases. By hovering the mouse over one of the parts of the Assessment Web, the explanation of this part becomes visible.",

    "home.entities.title": "Entities, elements and development phases",
    "home.entities.text.part1": "Three elements can be distinguished within each assessment entity. These are the elements quality criteria, design and quality assurance. The first element, quality criteria, concerns the question of what information is used to achieve and establish the quality of the assessment entities. The second element, design, focuses on the question of how the development and deployment of the five assessment entities are achieved. The third element, quality assurance, focuses on the way in which the quality assurance of the assessment entities is organised. Structural attention to these three elements ensures that work is done from the PDCA cycle.",
    "home.entities.text.part2": "A team of a degree course can develop the quality of assessment. Four development phases are distinguished. In the web, these phases of development are symbolized as boxes.",
    "home.entities.text.part3": "For each assessment entity, a short description is available for each development phase about how the assessment entity is filled in during that phase. To make this description visible, move your mouse over these parts of the Assessment Web.",

    "home.startscan.title": "Start the Scan",
    "home.startscan.text": "If you want to run the Assessment Web Scan, make sure you can work with your team at the same time. Completing the scan, if you do that as a team, takes at least an hour. You can also choose to first have the scan completed individually, then discuss this in the team and complete the scan again together. Once you have clicked 'start', the scan will start. For each assessment entity and then per element (quality criteria, design and assurance), you are asked to choose a place in the Assessment Web. You fill in both the current position and your ambition. You have the opportunity to give an explanation of this. At the end of the scan, the result will be displayed and you will have the option to download the result.",

    "phase.activityoriented.description": "Individual employees in the degree course (teachers/examiners, coursemanagement, examination board of examiners, assessment experts/assessment committee, support staff) carry out parts of assessment activities on an ad hoc basis, whereby there is no attention to the interrelationship between these activities.",
    "phase.processoriented.title": "2. Process-oriented phase",
    "phase.processoriented.description": "Relevant employees in the degree course (teachers/examiners, coursemanagement, examination board of examiners, assessment experts/assessment committee, support staff) carry out interrelated process-oriented assessment activities based on short-term policy.",

    "phase.systemoriented.description": "All relevant staff and partners in the degree course (students, teachers/examiners, coursemanagement, examination board of examiners, assessment experts/assessment committee, support staff) jointly carry out assessment activities from a medium-term perspective according to the PDCA cycle that are integrated into ongoing processes within the degree course.",
    "phase.chainoriented.title": "4. Chain-oriented phase",
    "phase.chainoriented.description": "All relevant employees and partners within the degree course and in the chain (students, teachers/examiners, coursemanagement, examination board of examiners, assessment experts/assessment committee, support staff, professional field and external experts) jointly carry out assessment activities from a long-term perspective according to the PDCA cycle that are integrated into ongoing processes within the degree course and the chain.",

    "assessmenttasks.activityoriented.description": "Teachers develop assessments as they see fit: they use their own quality criteria, often design the assessments on their own and shortly before administering the assessment. The quality of the assessments is evaluated only when there is reason to do so.",
    "assessmenttasks.processoriented.description": "Teachers develop assessments using an assessments cycle or design process and use quality criteria that are based on the experiences of experienced assessment developers. The assessments, which are developed during the teaching period, are made together with colleagues. The quality of the assessments is regularly evaluated by the teachers involved. The results are not necessarily discussed with colleagues or students but are used to improve their own assessments.",
    "assessmenttasks.systemoriented.description": "Teachers' quality criteria when developing assessments are regularly adjusted based on current (scientific) insights. The assessments, developed prior to the teaching, are appropriate for the learning outcomes and fit in with earlier education. The quality of assessments is structurally evaluated based on the quality criteria. The results are discussed with relevant partners within the degree course.",
    "assessmenttasks.chainoriented.description": "The quality criteria used in the design of both the assessments and the learning and assessment objectives are discussed with the professional field. These assessments match not only the study programma that the student follows within the degree  course, but also what is learned in the workplace. Assessments are structurally evaluated on the basis of the quality criteria. The results are discussed with both the relevant partners within the degree course and the professional field.",
    "assessmentprogram.activityoriented.description": "Within the degree course, it has not been determined which quality criteria the assessment programme should meet. Every teacher develops his own assessments, but there is no overview of the coherence between the assessments. Therefore, it is impossible to establish with certainty that the assessments collectively cover the intended learning outcomes.",
    "assessmentprogram.processoriented.description": "In the degree course quality criteria have been established for the assessment programme. The intended learning outcomes form the basis for designing the assessment programme. With some regularity, the assessment programme's coverage and feasibility are evaluated. The results are not necessarily discussed with all colleagues or students but are used to improve the assessment programme.",
    "assessmentprogram.systemoriented.description": "The quality criteria for developing the assessment programme are regularly adjusted based on new (scientific) insights. During development, attention is paid to both horizontal and vertical coherence between the assessments. There is also consultation on the most suitable assessment design, assessment functions, and the number of assessments. The quality of the assessment programme is structurally evaluated based on the quality criteria. The results are discussed with relevant partners within the degree course.",
    "assessmentprogram.chainoriented.description": "The quality criteria and the structure of the assessment programme are discussed with the professional field. Programme components that take place in the workplace are coordinated with the professional field so that they are feasible and appropriate. The assessment programme is structurally evaluated on the basis of the quality criteria. The results are discussed with both the relevant partners within the degree course and the professional field.",
    "assessmentpolicy.activityoriented.description": "Within the degree course, it has not been determined which quality requirements an assessment (policy) plan must meet. The policy plan is mainly a description of (separate) assessment processes. These are not yet (completely) in line with the vision on education. The quality of the policy plan is only evaluated if there is reason to do so.",
    "assessmentpolicy.processoriented.description": "Within the degree course, quality criteria have been established for the assessment (policy) plan. The vision on education and the assessment framework of the institution form the basis for the policy plan. In addition to assessment processes, the policy plan includes interventions describing how the ambitions will be achieved. The quality, feasibility, and practicality of the policy plan are evaluated at regular intervals. The results are not automatically discussed with all colleagues or students, but are used to adjust the policy plan.",
    "assessmentpolicy.systemoriented.description": "The quality criteria used in developing the assessment (policy) plan are regularly adjusted based on current (scientific) insights. Current (scientific) knowledge is used to develop processes and interventions. The policy plan, the vision on education and the assessment framework of the institution connect seamlessly. The policy plan is structurally evaluated based on the quality criteria. The results are discussed with relevant partners within the degree course.",
    "assessmentpolicy.chainoriented.description": "The quality criteria set for the assessment (policy) plan are discussed with relevant internal and/or external partners and are in line with the national frameworks. The processes and interventions included in the policy plan are aimed at the long term. Intermediate goals have been set so that mid-term evaluation is possible. The policy plan is structurally evaluated based on the quality criteria, and the results are discussed with both the relevant partners within the degree course and the professional field",
    "assessmentorganisation.activityoriented.description": "Within the degree course, it has not been determined which quality criteria the assessment organisation should meet. The teachers design the assessment processes as they see fit. Agreements have been made about the assessment processes' roles, tasks and responsibilities, but employees only know which responsibilities they themselves have to meet. The quality of the assessment organisation is only evaluated when there is reason to do so.",
    "assessmentorganisation.processoriented.description": "Quality criteria have been established for the assessment organisation within the degree course. All roles, tasks and responsibilities have been defined, so everyone knows who is responsible for what. It is clear to everyone how the various assessment processes relate to or should relate to each other. However, the processes do not yet seamlessly align with each other. The quality of the assessment organisation is evaluated regularly. The results are not automatically discussed with all colleagues or students but are used to improve assessment processes.",
    "assessmentorganisation.systemoriented.description": "The quality criteria used in setting up the assessment organisation are regularly adjusted based on current (scientific) insights. The roles, tasks and responsibilities in the degree course are regularly discussed and aligned with each other. The quality of the assessment organisation is structurally evaluated based on the quality criteria. The results are discussed with relevant partners within the degree course.",
    "assessmentorganisation.chainoriented.description": "The quality criteria and the assessment organisation's structure are discussed with the professional field. The roles, tasks and responsibilities of the professional field in the assessment organisation are laid down, as well as the assessment processes which take place at the workplace. The quality of the assessment organisation is structurally evaluated based on the quality criteria, and the results are discussed with the relevant partners within the degree course and the professional field.",
    "assessmentliteracy.activityoriented.description": "Within the degree course no (concrete) agreements have been made about the assessment literacy expected from teachers. The responsibility for the development of assessment literacy lies with individual teachers. Teachers' assessment literacy is only evaluated when there is reason to do so.",
    "assessmentliteracy.processoriented.description": "The requirements for assessment literacy within the degree course are based on the experiences of experienced assessment developers. For all employees in the assessment organisation, the required assessment literacy has been laid down. To realise this literacy, concrete goals have been formulated. Both the status of the development of assessment literacy and the quality of assessment literacy are evaluated regularly. The results are not automatically discussed with all colleagues or students but are used to initiate actions to improve assessment literacy.",
    "assessmentliteracy.systemoriented.description": "The requirements for assessment literacy are regularly adjusted based on (national) frameworks and current insights. The required assessment literacy is not only established at an individual level but also at a team level. A targeted effort is made to professionalise employees and teams. The quality of assessment literacy is structurally evaluated based on the requirements for assessment literacy. The results are discussed with relevant partners within the degree course and serve as a basis for designing development plans.",
    "assessmentliteracy.chainoriented.description": "The requirements for assessment literacy are discussed with internal and/or relevant external partners and are in line with the national frameworks. Also for the partners from the professional field, it has been determined which Assessment literacy they must have. The quality of the assessment literacy of all partners in the assessment organisation is structurally evaluated based on the requirements for assessment literacy, and the results are discussed with the relevant partners within the degree course and the professional field.",
